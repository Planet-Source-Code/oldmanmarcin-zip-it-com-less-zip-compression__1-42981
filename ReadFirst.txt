Hey...
Before running the program you  have to install the Java Class on your computer.
To do that simply copy ZipFunctions.class file to your system directory:
<System Directory>\Java\trustlib 
example:
c:\winnt\Java\trustlib , c:\windows\Java\trustlib  or c:\winCrash2000\Java\trustlib 

So when you distribute a program that uses this method make sure you copy this file using your installation program.
